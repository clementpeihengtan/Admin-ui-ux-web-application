# Admin-ui-ux-web-application
A web application powered by AngularJS, that provide a user interface for administration to monitor performance and carry out data analysis. Carry out testing with Karma and Jasmine.

## Tools used 

* AngularJS
* bootstrap
* Karma 
* Jasmine
* ChartJS

This tools allow me to create a responsive user interface for this web application using bootstrap and AngularJS as well as carrying out unit testing systematically. 

## Why AngularJS?

1. Single Page Application 

- The first reason is that I am going to create a Single Page application, which means the application load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app without constant page reload. This reduces the number of calls between server and client, which in turn increases the efficiency of the web application and reduces the overhead. AngularJS serves this purpose by using JavaScript to create a dynamically responsive web application. 

2. Faster (Development)

- It is faster to develop using Angular compare to other framework like React, since React has a lot of libraries and it is sometimes hard to decide which one to be used so that it will not cause any problem in the future especially when scaling the application.

3. Testing

- AngularJS is also unit testing ready, which means we can use some testing tool that can directly implemented into angular itself, one of them is Jasmine.
